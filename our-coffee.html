                <h2>Processing</h2>
                <div>Coffee berries and their seeds undergo several
                     processes before they become the familiar roasted
                      coffee. Berries have been traditionally
                       selectively picked by hand; a labor-intensive
                        method, it involves the selection of only the
                         berries at the peak of ripeness. More commonly,
                         crops are strip picked, where all berries are
                          harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness
                           by person or machine.</div>

            <h2>Roasting</h2>
                <div>The next step in the process is the roasting of the
                     green coffee. Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state,
                      and with rare exceptions, such as infusions from green
                       coffee beans,[92] coffee is roasted before it is consumed.
                        It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home
                         roasted.[93] The roasting process influences the taste of
                          the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically
                           and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture
                            is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become 
                            less dense. The density of the bean also influences the
                             strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.</div>

            <h2>Decaffeination</h2>
                <div>Decaffeination of coffee seeds is done while
                     the seeds are still green. Many methods can
                      remove caffeine from coffee, but all involve
                       either soaking the green seeds in hot water
                        (often called the "Swiss water process")
                         or steaming them, then using a solvent to
                          dissolve caffeine-containing oils.
                           Decaffeination is often done by processing
                            companies, and the extracted caffeine is
                             usually sold to the pharmaceutical industry.</div>

            <h2>Storage</h2>
                <div>Coffee is best stored in an airtight container made of ceramic,
                     glass or non-reactive metal. Higher quality prepackaged
                      coffee usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from
                       entering while allowing the coffee to release gases.
                        Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved when it is
                         stored away from moisture, heat, and light.
                          The tendency of coffee to absorb strong smells
                           from food means that it should be kept away from
                            such smells. Storage of coffee in refrigerators is
                             not recommended due to the presence of moisture which
                              can cause deterioration.</div>

            <h2>Serving</h2>
                <div>Once brewed, coffee may be served in a variety of ways.
                     Drip-brewed, percolated, or French-pressed/cafetière
                      coffee may be served as white coffee with a dairy
                       product such as milk or cream, or dairy substitute,
                        or as black coffee with no such addition.
                         It may be sweetened with sugar or artificial
                          sweetener. When served cold, it is called
                           iced coffee.</div>

            <h2>Instant coffee</h2>
                <div>A number of products are sold for the convenience of
                     consumers who do not want to prepare their own coffee
                      or who do not have access to coffeemaking equipment.
                       Instant coffee is dried into soluble powder or
                        freeze-dried into granules that can be quickly
                         dissolved in hot water. Originally invented
                          in 1907, it rapidly gained in popularity
                           in many countries in the post-war period,
                            with Nescafé being the most popular product.
                             Many consumers determined that the convenience
                              in preparing a cup of instant coffee more than
                               made up for a perceived inferior taste,
                                although, since the late 1970s,
                                 instant coffee has been produced differently
                                  in such a way that is similar to the taste
                                   of freshly brewed coffee.</div>
