                    <h2>coffee history</h2>The history of coffee dates back to the 15th century,
                     and possibly earlier with a number of reports and legends surrounding
                      its first use. The earliest substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking
                       or knowledge of the coffee tree is from the early 15th century,
                        in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen, spreading soon to Mecca and Medina.
                         By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East,
                          South India (Karnataka), Persia, Turkey, the Horn of Africa,
                           and northern Africa. Coffee then spread to the Balkans,
                            Italy, and to the rest of Europe, as well as Southeast Asia and despite
                             the bans imposed during the 15th century by religious leaders in Mecca and Cairo,
                              and later by the Catholic Church.</div>

                <h2>Production</h2>
                <div>Coffee berries and their seeds undergo several processes before
                     they become the familiar roasted coffee. Berries have been traditionally 
                     selectively picked by hand; a labor-intensive method,
                      it involves the selection of only the berries at the peak of ripeness.
                       More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are
                        harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine.
                         After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two methodsâ€”the
                          dry process method, simpler and less labor-intensive as the berries
                           can be strip picked, and the wet process method, which incorporates
                            fermentation into the process and yields a mild coffee.</div>
